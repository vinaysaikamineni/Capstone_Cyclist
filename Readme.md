<h3>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h3>
<p>Most of the values for columns 'start_lon', 'start_lat', 'end_lon', 'end_lat' were NaN. Hence we dropped these columns.</p>
<p>We had converted the 'start_at', 'ended_at' columns to Data_time datatype.</p>
<p>Added new column 'ride_Journey' which is the total time took for the journey in Minutes</p>
<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
<p>I had used PowerBI to visualize my final processed data and grasp some patterns and habits of differnet riders.</p>
